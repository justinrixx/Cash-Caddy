# Cash-Caddy
I created this as a way to play around with the new Design Support Library, as well as pick up some SQLite skills on the way.
The idea with this app is that it tracks the budget you set for different categories. When you open the home screen, you can
see immediatley whether you're winning or losing. With support for completely custom categories, doing the math for you, and
a log to see your past transactions, this will have you on track in no time! I use it myself to track my finances!

It's still in devlopment; I'm using as my learning app for now. But a stable version is on the play store! [Get it here!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.rixx.justin.envelopebudget)
